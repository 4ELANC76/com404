#Yoda wishes to create a program which will help him pick a Jedi apprentice.
#The program should start by displaying the message "Have you fear in your heart?"
#The program should then read in the user’s string.
#The program should then decide if the user can be a Jedi. 
#If the user’s response is "yes" then the message "Fear is the path to the dark side. You cannot be a Jedi apprentice." should be displayed. 
#Otherwise the message "The force is strong in you. You may be a Jedi apprentice." should be displayed.


print("Have you fear in your heart?")
fear = str(input())

if(fear == "yes"):
  print("Fear is the path to the dark side. You cannot be a Jedi apprentice.")
else:
  print("The force is strong in you. You may be a Jedi apprentice.")
