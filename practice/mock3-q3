#Dr Bravestone wishes to create a program which will help him escape the Jumanji jungle.
#The program should start by displaying the message "How many zones must I cross?"
#The program should then read in the user’s whole number.
#The program should then display the message "Crossing zones...". 
#The program should then display all the numbers from the user's whole number to 1 in the form "…crossed zone [number]" where [number] is the zone number.
#Finally, the program should display the message "Crossed all zones.  Jumanji!"
