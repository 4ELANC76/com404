#Decision

#Gemma wishes to create a program which works out if a number is even or odd. The program should start by prompting the user to enter a whole number.
#The program should then read in the user’s whole number.
#The program should then decide if the user’s whole number is even or odd.
#If the user’s whole number is even then the message “Is even” should be displayed.
#Otherwise the message “Is odd” should be displayed


print("Please enter a whole number:")
number = int(input())
if(number % 2 == 0):
  print("Is even")
else:
  print("Is odd")
